# DatabaseManager

A DataFlex library for building a standalone Database Manager application.  
Define your database schema in code, compile your own manager app, and run it to ensure the physical database exists and matches your model — creating or altering tables and fields as needed.

---

## Getting Started

1. Add this library to your DataFlex workspace.  
2. Create a new DataFlex application that uses the library.  
3. Model your database schema in code (as objects).  
4. Compile and run your Database Manager application.  
5. The application will ensure your database exists and matches your model, applying any required schema changes.

## Requirements

- DataFlex 25.0 or later
